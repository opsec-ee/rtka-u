_recursive (infinite recursion) ternary, unknown preservation, confidence propagation and early termination_

RTKA represents a mathematically rigorous formal logic framework designed for computational uncertainty reasoning in systems requiring deterministic guarantees. Unlike statistical or machine learning approaches to confidence scoring, this framework implements recursive ternary logic operations with formal proofs and algebraic guarantees for uncertainty propagation. The confidence quantification follows established mathematical principles rather than probabilistic estimates, making it suitable for safety-critical applications in sensor fusion, fault-tolerant systems, and formal verification domains where mathematical correctness remains paramount.

The framework extends strong three-valued logic through recursive processing of ternary truth values represented as T = {-1, 0, 1}, corresponding to FALSE, UNKNOWN, and TRUE states respectively. This mathematical foundation incorporates sophisticated confidence propagation mechanisms that preserve uncertainty throughout the computational pipeline, resolving ambiguity only when logical determination becomes mathematically necessary. The implementation achieves exceptional computational efficiency with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space requirements, suitable for real-time applications in resource-constrained environments.

The architecture enables critical services across industries demanding robust handling of uncertainty and incomplete data. This capability proves essential for artificial intelligence systems operating with partial information, sensor fusion networks processing conflicting inputs, and enterprise decision-making platforms where complete information rarely exists. The system provides deterministic processing methods for inherently non-deterministic problems while maintaining mathematical rigor and operational efficiency throughout the decision pipeline.

## Mathematical Foundation
[`Mathematical Rigor`](https://opsec-ee.github.io/rtka-u/docs/index.html)

The framework transforms classical Boolean logic through recursive ternary evaluation, where uncertainty becomes a branching point for deeper analysis. This creates a fractal decision structure where UNKNOWN states serve as gateways to progressive resolution refinement rather than terminal conditions.

_Uncertainty doesn't have to be binary or even ternary - it can be infinitely recursive. When faced with MAYBE, instead of stopping, RTKA asks: "What if it's actually false? What if it stays uncertain? What if it's actually true?" - and each of these spawns another complete ternary decision space.
This is fundamentally different from any known ternary algorithm, which treats their three states as final outcomes rather than gateways to deeper uncertainty resolution._

## Disclaimer

_This software implements the mathematically sound Recursive Ternary Knowledge Algorithm (RTKA) based on validated Kleene logic principles. While the algorithm itself is theoretically correct and suitable for commercial applications under appropriate licensing, this particular implementation is experimental research code that may not be suitable for production use. The codebase demonstrates algorithmic feasibility but lacks the comprehensive testing, optimization, and hardening required for deployment.
