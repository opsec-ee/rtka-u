## Overview

This is a RTKA-based control system for robotic applications, specifically designed to handle the double pendulum stabilization problem. The system demonstrates how RTKA's recursive ternary logic with confidence propagation can be used for continuous control in chaotic nonlinear systems.

**VALIDATION STATUS:** NEW - Requires simulation and hardware validation

## What This Solves

The double pendulum is notoriously difficult for robotics because:

1. **Chaotic dynamics** - Extreme sensitivity to initial conditions
2. **Nonlinear coupling** - Complex interaction between joints
3. **Noisy sensors** - Encoders and gyroscopes have measurement errors
4. **State estimation** - Velocities must be estimated from position
5. **Control in uncertainty** - Must make decisions with incomplete information

RTKA addresses the **perception and decision layer**:
- Multi-sensor fusion with variance weighting
- Confidence-driven control output mapping
- Hierarchical mode switching for safety
- Graceful degradation under sensor failures

```

## Key Components

### Confidence-Driven Proportional Control
- Maps confidence values [0,1] to control outputs
- Low confidence (0.0-0.3) → increase control effort
- Moderate confidence (0.3-0.7) → steady state
- High confidence (0.7-1.0) → reduce control effort
- Includes rate limiting and saturation handling

### Hierarchical Mode Switching
- **NOMINAL**: Full performance (C > 0.7)
- **DEGRADED**: Reduced gains (0.4 < C ≤ 0.7)
- **SAFE**: Minimal operation (0.1 < C ≤ 0.4)
- **EMERGENCY**: System shutdown (C ≤ 0.1)
- Hysteresis prevents mode chattering
- Dwell time requirements for stability

### Double Pendulum Control
- Complete implementation for double pendulum
- Energy-based mode adaptation
- Controllability region detection
- Realistic sensor modeling

## Physics Implementation

The simulation uses **REAL double pendulum dynamics** (not fake/simplified):

**Lagrangian Equations of Motion:**
```
θ₁'' = [-m₂l₁θ₁'²sin(Δ)cos(Δ) + m₂g·sin(θ₂)cos(Δ) - m₂l₂θ₂'²sin(Δ) 
        - (m₁+m₂)g·sin(θ₁) - b₁θ₁' + τ] / [l₁(m₁ + m₂sin²(Δ))]

θ₂'' = [(m₁+m₂)(l₁θ₁'²sin(Δ) - g·sin(θ₂) + g·sin(θ₁)cos(Δ)) 
        + m₂l₂θ₂'²sin(Δ)cos(Δ) - b₂θ₂' + τcos(Δ)] / [l₂(m₁ + m₂sin²(Δ))]
```

**Integration:** Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4) - accurate for stiff nonlinear ODEs

## Building

```bash
make            # Compile everything
make run        # Build and run simulation
make clean      # Remove build artifacts
make rebuild    # Clean and rebuild
make valgrind   # Check for memory leaks
```

**Requirements:**
- GCC with C23 support (or C11 fallback)
- Math library (libm)
- Optional: valgrind, cppcheck, clang-format

## Running the Simulation

```bash
./rtka_pendulum_sim
```

**Test Scenarios:**

1. **Small Perturbation** (θ₁=0.1, θ₂=0.05)
   - Tests linearized control region
   - Should quickly return to equilibrium

2. **Large Excursion** (θ₁=0.5, θ₂=-0.4)
   - Tests mode switching
   - Should stabilize despite nonlinearity

3. **High Velocity** (ω₁=2.0, ω₂=1.5)
   - Tests energy dissipation
   - Should handle high kinetic energy

4. **Sensor Failure** (Gyro failure at t=2.5s)
   - Tests fault tolerance
   - Should continue with degraded performance

## Example Output

```
t=0.00s: θ₁=0.1000, θ₂=0.0500, E=0.123J, τ=2.456Nm, C=0.810 [NOMINAL]
t=0.10s: θ₁=0.0923, θ₂=0.0445, E=0.098J, τ=2.234Nm, C=0.825 [NOMINAL]
t=0.20s: θ₁=0.0851, θ₂=0.0392, E=0.076J, τ=2.012Nm, C=0.841 [NOMINAL]

## What This Does NOT Solve

Be clear about limitations:

1. **Trajectory Planning** - No path planning, just stabilization
2. **Optimal Control** - Heuristic feedback, not MPC/LQR
3. **Stability Guarantees** - No formal Lyapunov proofs (yet)
4. **Hardware Integration** - Simulation only, needs hardware adaptation
5. **Parameter Tuning** - Requires empirical calibration

## Validation Requirements

Before real-world deployment:

1. **Physics Accuracy** - Verify against known double pendulum solutions
2. **Baseline Comparison** - Compare with PID, LQR, MPC controllers
3. **Hardware Testing** - Validate on physical pendulum system
4. **Stability Analysis** - Phase portraits, Lyapunov exponents
5. **Robustness Testing** - Monte Carlo over initial conditions
6. **Sensor Noise Sweep** - Test across variance levels
7. **Safety Validation** - Failure mode analysis

## Engineering Principles


## Integration with RTKA Core

This builds on proven RTKA foundations:

- Adaptive consensus fusion (Bayesian threshold)
- Discrete-continuous hybrid optimization
- Hysteresis for stability
- Variance-weighted sensor fusion
- Bayesian adaptive threshold evolution

The core ternary logic operations (∧, ∨, ¬) and confidence propagation 
(C∧ = ∏cᵢ, C∨ = 1-∏(1-cᵢ)) are empirically validated with <0.5% error.

## Future Work

1. **Hardware Deployment**
   - Interface with real encoders, gyroscopes, IMUs
   - Motor driver integration
   - Real-time constraints

2. **Advanced Control**
   - Model predictive control (MPC) with RTKA confidence
   - Learning-based adaptation
   - Energy-based control (swing-up)

3. **Multi-Robot Systems**
   - Extend to manipulators (6-DOF arms)
   - Quadruped locomotion
   - Humanoid balance control

4. **Formal Verification**
   - Lyapunov stability proofs
   - Basin of attraction characterization
   - Safety guarantees
