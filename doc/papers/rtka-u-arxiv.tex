\begin{abstract}
I present RTKA-U (Recursive Ternary with Kleene Algorithm + UNKNOWN), a novel recursive ternary logic system that extends strong Kleene logic to handle uncertainty propagation in sequential and confidence-weighted operations. The framework operates on the domain $\mathbb{T} = \{-1, 0, 1\}$ representing FALSE, UNKNOWN, and TRUE respectively, with arithmetic encodings enabling efficient computation through minimum (conjunction), maximum (disjunction), and negation operations. I introduce the UNKNOWN Preservation Theorem, which formalizes conditions under which uncertainty persists through logical operations, and demonstrate that the probability of UNKNOWN persistence follows the model $P(\text{UNKNOWN persists}) = (2/3)^{n-1}$ for sequences of length $n$. The framework incorporates confidence propagation using product rules for conjunction and inclusion-exclusion principles for disjunction, enabling applications in fault-tolerant systems, probabilistic reasoning, and decision-making under incomplete information. Empirical validation through 10,000 Monte Carlo trials per configuration confirms theoretical predictions with less than 1\% average error. Implementations in both C and Python demonstrate computational efficiency of $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time complexity with early termination optimization and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ space complexity in iterative implementations.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Traditional binary logic systems face fundamental limitations when processing incomplete or uncertain data, often forcing premature resolution that leads to information loss or erroneous conclusions. While ternary logic systems such as Kleene's strong three-valued logic \cite{kleene1952} introduce an UNKNOWN state to represent uncertainty, existing frameworks lack robust mechanisms for recursive application over sequences and systematic confidence integration.

This paper introduces RTKA-U, a comprehensive framework that extends Kleene's strong ternary logic with recursive evaluation capabilities and confidence propagation mechanisms. This system addresses three critical challenges in uncertainty handling: the preservation of UNKNOWN states through logical operations, the quantification of confidence in ternary outcomes, and the efficient computation of recursive operations over variable-length sequences.

The key contributions of this work include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A formal mathematical framework for recursive ternary logic with arithmetic encodings that enable efficient computation
\item The UNKNOWN Preservation Theorem, which characterizes when uncertainty persists through logical operations
\item A probabilistic model demonstrating that UNKNOWN persistence follows $(2/3)^{n-1}$ decay for random input sequences
\item Confidence propagation mechanisms based on product rules and inclusion-exclusion principles
\item Practical implementations with early termination optimization achieving linear time complexity
\item Empirical validation confirming theoretical predictions across 200,000 simulation trials
\end{enumerate}

\section{Mathematical Framework}

\subsection{Domain Definition}

I define the ternary domain $\mathbb{T} = \{-1, 0, 1\}$ with the following interpretations:
\begin{align}
-1 &\equiv \text{FALSE} \\
0 &\equiv \text{UNKNOWN} \\
1 &\equiv \text{TRUE}
\end{align}

This arithmetic encoding enables efficient computation through standard mathematical operations while preserving logical semantics.

\subsection{Core Operations}

The fundamental Kleene operations are defined arithmetically as follows:

\begin{definition}[Kleene Operations]
For $a, b \in \mathbb{T}$:
\begin{align}
\text{Negation: } &\neg a = -a \\
\text{Conjunction: } &a \land b = \min(a, b) \\
\text{Disjunction: } &a \lor b = \max(a, b) \\
\text{Equivalence: } &a \leftrightarrow b = a \times b
\end{align}
\end{definition}

These operations satisfy the strong Kleene truth tables while admitting efficient implementation through arithmetic operations.

\subsection{Recursive Evaluation}

For an operation $\phi \in \{\land_r, \lor_r, \neg_r\}$ and input vector $\vec{x} = \langle x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \rangle \in \mathbb{T}^n$, I define the recursive evaluation:

\begin{definition}[Recursive Form]
\begin{equation}
\phi(\vec{x}) = \begin{cases}
x_1 & \text{if } n = 1 \\
\phi(x_1, \phi(\langle x_2, \ldots, x_n \rangle)) & \text{if } n > 1
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

This recursive structure enables sequential processing while maintaining associativity for binary operations.

\section{UNKNOWN Preservation Theorem}

\begin{theorem}[UNKNOWN Preservation]
Let $\vec{x} = \langle x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \rangle \in \mathbb{T}^n$ with $x_1 = 0$ (UNKNOWN). Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For conjunction: $\land_r(\vec{x}) = 0$ if and only if $\forall i \in [2,n]: x_i \neq -1$
\item For disjunction: $\lor_r(\vec{x}) = 0$ if and only if $\forall i \in [2,n]: x_i \neq 1$
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
I prove by induction on sequence length.

Base case ($n=2$): For $\vec{x} = \langle 0, x_2 \rangle$:
\begin{itemize}
\item $0 \land x_2 = \min(0, x_2) = 0$ if and only if $x_2 \in \{0, 1\}$ (i.e., $x_2 \neq -1$)
\item $0 \lor x_2 = \max(0, x_2) = 0$ if and only if $x_2 \in \{0, -1\}$ (i.e., $x_2 \neq 1$)
\end{itemize}

Inductive step: Assume the theorem holds for sequences of length $k$. For length $k+1$, the recursive evaluation preserves UNKNOWN if and only if both the first operation preserves UNKNOWN and the recursive evaluation of the tail preserves UNKNOWN, which occurs precisely when no absorbing element appears in the sequence.
\end{proof}

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{UNKNOWN Persistence Probability}

Consider a sequence beginning with UNKNOWN followed by $n-1$ inputs drawn uniformly from $\mathbb{T}$.

\begin{proposition}[Persistence Probability]
The probability that UNKNOWN persists through $n$ inputs is:
\begin{equation}
P(\text{UNKNOWN persists} \mid n) = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{n-1}
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Each random input from $\mathbb{T}$ has probability $1/3$ of being an absorbing element (FALSE for conjunction, TRUE for disjunction). Therefore, the probability of avoiding absorption at each step is $2/3$. For $n-1$ independent random inputs, the probability of avoiding absorption throughout is $(2/3)^{n-1}$.
\end{proof}

\section{Confidence Propagation}

\subsection{Confidence Measures}

I associate each ternary value with a confidence measure $c \in [0,1]$ representing the reliability of the logical assessment.

\begin{definition}[Confidence Propagation Rules]
For input confidences $\vec{c} = \langle c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n \rangle$:
\begin{align}
\text{Conjunction: } C(\land_r) &= \prod_{i=1}^{n} c_i \\
\text{Disjunction: } C(\lor_r) &= 1 - \prod_{i=1}^{n} (1 - c_i) \\
\text{Negation: } C(\neg) &= c_1 \\
\text{Equivalence: } C(\leftrightarrow) &= \sqrt[n]{\prod_{i=1}^{n} c_i}
\end{align}
\end{definition}

These rules reflect the intuition that conjunction requires all inputs to be reliable, while disjunction succeeds if any input is reliable.

\section{Implementation and Optimization}

\subsection{Algorithmic Complexity}

The recursive evaluation admits both recursive and iterative implementations:

\begin{itemize}
\item Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$ for $n$ inputs
\item Space Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$ for recursive, $\mathcal{O}(1)$ for iterative
\item Early Termination: Average case improvement through absorbing element detection
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Early Termination Optimization}

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Recursive Ternary Evaluation with Early Termination}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE Input vector $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{T}^n$, operation $\phi$
\ENSURE Result $r \in \mathbb{T}$
\STATE $accumulator \leftarrow x_1$
\FOR{$i = 2$ to $n$}
    \STATE $accumulator \leftarrow \phi(accumulator, x_i)$
    \IF{($\phi = \land$ AND $accumulator = -1$) OR ($\phi = \lor$ AND $accumulator = 1$)}
        \RETURN $accumulator$ \COMMENT{Early termination on absorbing element}
    \ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\RETURN $accumulator$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Empirical Validation}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

I conducted Monte Carlo simulations with 10,000 trials per configuration to validate theoretical predictions. Tests were performed for sequence lengths $n \in [1, 20]$ with inputs drawn uniformly from $\mathbb{T}$.

\subsection{Results}

Table \ref{tab:validation} presents empirical results compared to theoretical predictions:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{UNKNOWN Persistence Probability Validation}
\label{tab:validation}
\begin{tabular}{@{}ccccc@{}}
\toprule
$n$ & Theoretical & AND Empirical & OR Empirical & Max Error \\
\midrule
1 & 1.0000 & 1.0000 & 1.0000 & 0.0000 \\
2 & 0.6667 & 0.6659 & 0.6667 & 0.0008 \\
3 & 0.4444 & 0.4404 & 0.4427 & 0.0040 \\
4 & 0.2963 & 0.2920 & 0.3034 & 0.0071 \\
5 & 0.1975 & 0.1948 & 0.1981 & 0.0027 \\
10 & 0.0260 & 0.0254 & 0.0258 & 0.0006 \\
15 & 0.0034 & 0.0033 & 0.0035 & 0.0001 \\
20 & 0.0005 & 0.0004 & 0.0005 & 0.0001 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The average error across all configurations was 0.12\% for AND operations and 0.15\% for OR operations, confirming the theoretical model with high accuracy.

\section{Applications}

\subsection{Sensor Fusion}

In autonomous systems, multiple sensors provide potentially conflicting readings. RTKA-U enables principled fusion while preserving uncertainty:

\begin{itemize}
\item OR operations for detection (any sensor detecting yields positive)
\item AND operations for validation (all sensors must agree)
\item Confidence propagation quantifies overall reliability
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evidence Chaining}

In diagnostic systems, evidence must be combined sequentially. RTKA-U provides:

\begin{itemize}
\item Preservation of uncertainty when evidence is incomplete
\item Early termination when contradictory evidence appears
\item Confidence decay tracking through the chain
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fault-Tolerant Networks}

For distributed systems with partial failures, RTKA-U models:

\begin{itemize}
\item Network paths with uncertain connectivity
\item Nested operations for complex topologies
\item Graceful degradation without complete failure
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Foundations of Three-Valued Logic}

Three-valued logics emerged in the mid-20th century to handle indeterminacy beyond binary true/false distinctions. While Łukasiewicz \cite{lukasiewicz1920} and Post \cite{post1921} laid early groundwork for multi-valued logics, Kleene's three-valued logic \cite{kleene1952} became foundational for computational applications. Kleene's ``strong'' logic defines operations using arithmetic encodings—minimum for conjunction, maximum for disjunction, and negation as sign flip—preserving unknown values unless logically forced to resolve. This conservative propagation makes it particularly suitable for partial information systems and influences modern applications from SQL's NULL handling to circuit verification with unknown signals.

These early logics extended classical truth-functionality to lattice structures (such as $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ for false, unknown, true), but critically lacked recursive formulations for chained operations, a gap that RTKA-U addresses through its recursive evaluation framework.

\subsection{Multi-Valued Logics and Uncertainty Management}

Multi-valued logics generalize binary systems to handle vagueness, incompleteness, and probability. Fitting \cite{fitting1991} characterizes Kleene's as a ``weak'' form for incomplete information, where unknown propagates conservatively. Fitting and Mendelsohn \cite{fitting1998} connect three-valued logics to rough sets, modeling uncertainty as boundary regions with applications in database querying and knowledge representation.

While Belnap \cite{belnap1975} developed four-valued extensions for handling information paradoxes, three-valued systems remain dominant for computational efficiency. Recent work by Fitting \cite{fitting2023} surveys three-valued logics with rough sets for incomplete information management, emphasizing propagation rules that preserve uncertainty without loss. Neutrosophic logic \cite{smarandache2005} extends to four values (true, false, unknown, undetermined) but lacks RTKA-U's recursive confidence integration.

In recursive contexts, multi-valued temporal logics \cite{chechik2001} apply Kleene logic to model checking for concurrent systems with uncertainty. Kozen's Kleene algebra \cite{kozen1994} provides algebraic foundations for regular languages and processes, though extensions to probabilistic uncertainty \cite{kozen2013} focus on concurrency rather than the decision propagation that RTKA-U addresses.

\subsection{Confidence Propagation in Logic Systems}

Confidence propagation in multi-valued logics addresses uncertainty quantification beyond discrete values. Hajek \cite{hajek1998} introduces fuzzy reasoning using lattice-based truth functions for vague propositions but lacks ternary-specific recursion. Real-valued logics by Esteva et al. \cite{esteva2000} model degrees of truth with propagation via product for conjunction and Łukasiewicz t-norm for disjunction, operating in continuous rather than discrete ternary domains.

Recent advances include real-valued logics for neuro-symbolic AI \cite{besold2022}, axiomatizing multidimensional sentences for uncertainty reasoning without RTKA-U's UNKNOWN preservation guarantees. In hardware ternary systems, CNTFET-based implementations \cite{reza2014} incorporate confidence for efficiency, though software propagation remains limited. Symmetric ternary logic \cite{symmetric2023} proposes composition methodologies but omits recursive confidence decay that RTKA-U formalizes.

\subsection{Applications in AI and Decision Systems}

Kleene logic increasingly applies to AI systems handling partial knowledge. In neurosymbolic AI, standard neural computation proves insufficient for logical reasoning with uncertainty, requiring hybrid approaches incorporating Kleene's logic \cite{neurosymbolic2025}. Algebraic reasoning in quantum programs uses non-idempotent Kleene algebra for uncertainty \cite{quantum2021}, relevant to AI optimization problems.

For decision systems, belief propagation in three-valued logic \cite{belief2022} supports AI decision-making under incomplete data, explicitly referencing Kleene for TVL (three-valued logic) implementations. Dynamic logic extensions \cite{dynamic2024} apply Kleene logic to program reasoning with applications in AI verification. Argumentation frameworks \cite{argumentation2025} encode Kleene logic for multi-agent AI debate systems handling uncertainty. Local Completeness Logic \cite{local2022} uses Kleene logic for proving program correctness and incorrectness with AI applications in formal verification.

\subsection{Gaps Addressed by RTKA-U}

While foundational works establish ternary systems and recent AI applications highlight the need for uncertainty-aware logics, critical gaps remain in the literature. Existing frameworks lack integrated recursive confidence propagation for decision chains, formal preservation theorems for uncertainty, and empirically validated probabilistic models for UNKNOWN persistence. Most implementations do not achieve the $\mathcal{O}(n)$ efficiency with early termination that practical systems require.

RTKA-U addresses these gaps through its recursive ternary operations with arithmetic encodings, formal UNKNOWN Preservation Theorem characterizing persistence conditions, confidence propagation using product rules and inclusion-exclusion principles, and empirically validated $(2/3)^{n-1}$ probability model for uncertainty decay. The framework's efficient implementation with early termination optimization makes it practical for real-world applications while maintaining theoretical rigor.

\section{Conclusion}

RTKA-U provides a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient framework for handling uncertainty in logical systems. The key contributions include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A recursive ternary logic system with proven UNKNOWN preservation properties
\item Empirically validated probabilistic model for uncertainty persistence
\item Efficient implementations with linear time complexity
\item Practical applications in sensor fusion, evidence chaining, and fault tolerance
\end{enumerate}

Future work includes extending the framework to continuous confidence values, investigating applications in machine learning systems, and developing hardware implementations for real-time systems.
