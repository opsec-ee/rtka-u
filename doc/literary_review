### Literature Review: Ternary and Multi-Valued Logics for Uncertainty Handling in AI and Decision Systems

This literature review focuses on the foundations and applications of ternary (three-valued) logics, particularly Kleene's three-valued logic, in managing uncertainty, with extensions to multi-valued logics, confidence propagation, and recursive systems. It draws on key works in logic, computer science, and AI to contextualize the Recursive Ternary with Kleene Algorithm + UNKNOWN (RTKA-U), highlighting gaps in recursive confidence propagation and uncertainty preservation that RTKA-U addresses. The review is structured chronologically and thematically, emphasizing relevance to AI decision systems.

#### Foundations of Three-Valued Logic
Three-valued logics emerged in the mid-20th century to handle indeterminacy or uncertainty beyond binary true/false, introducing a third value (often "unknown" or "undefined"). Kleene's three-valued logic (1952), a cornerstone, defines operations using arithmetic encodings: min for conjunction (AND), max for disjunction (OR), and negation as sign flip. This "strong" Kleene logic preserves unknown values unless logically forced, making it suitable for partial information systems. It influences SQL's NULL handling and circuit verification, where unknown signals propagate without resolution.

Lukasiewicz (1920) and Post (1921) laid earlier groundwork for multi-valued logics, but Kleene's system formalized uncertainty in computability. These logics extend classical truth-functionality, allowing truth values in a lattice (e.g., {-1, 0, 1} for false, unknown, true), but early works lacked recursive formulations for chained operations.

#### Multi-Valued Logics and Uncertainty Management
Multi-valued logics generalize binary systems to handle vagueness, incompleteness, or probability, often integrating rough sets or fuzzy logic for uncertainty. Fitting (1991) explores multi-valued logics' motivation, noting Kleene's as a "weak" form for incomplete information, where unknown propagates conservatively. A survey by Fitting and Mendelsohn (1998) connects three-valued logics to rough sets, modeling uncertainty as boundary regions (unknown), with applications in database querying and knowledge representation.

Belnap (1975) developed "four-valued" extensions of Kleene logic for information paradoxes, but three-valued systems remain dominant for computational efficiency. Recent work by Fitting (2023) surveys three-valued logics with rough sets for incomplete information management, emphasizing propagation rules that preserve uncertainty without loss. Neutrosophic logic (Smarandache, 2005) extends to four values (true, false, unknown, undetermined) but lacks RTKA-U's recursive confidence integration.

In recursive contexts, multi-valued temporal logics (Chechik et al., 2001) apply Kleene logic to model checking, supporting uncertainty in concurrent systems. Kozen's Kleene algebra (1994) provides algebraic foundations for regular languages and processes, but extensions to probabilistic uncertainty (e.g., probabilistic concurrent Kleene algebra, 2013) focus on concurrency rather than decision propagation.

#### Confidence Propagation in Logic Systems
Confidence or probabilistic propagation in multi-valued logics addresses uncertainty quantification. Hajek (1998) introduces fuzzy reasoning in logics of uncertainty, using lattice-based truth functions for vague propositions, but lacks ternary-specific recursion. Real-valued logics (e.g., [0,1]-valued) by Esteva et al. (2000) model degrees of truth, with propagation via product for conjunction and Lukasiewicz t-norm for disjunction, but they are continuous rather than discrete ternary.

Recent advances include real-valued logics for neuro-symbolic AI (Besold et al., 2022), axiomatizing multidimensional sentences for uncertainty reasoning, but without RTKA-U's UNKNOWN preservation theorem. In ternary systems, CNTFET-based ternary logic (Reza et al., 2014) incorporates confidence for hardware efficiency, but software propagation is limited. Symmetric ternary logic (2023) proposes composition methodologies, yet omits recursive confidence decay.

#### Applications in AI and Decision Systems
Kleene logic applies to AI for handling partial knowledge. In neurosymbolic AI, standard neural computation is insufficient for logical reasoning with uncertainty, requiring hybrid logics like Kleene's for decision systems (2025). Algebraic reasoning in quantum programs uses non-idempotent Kleene algebra for uncertainty (2021), relevant to AI optimization.

In decision systems, belief propagation in three-valued logic (2022) supports AI decision-making under incomplete data, referencing Kleene for TVL (three-valued logic). Dynamic logic (2024) extends Kleene for program reasoning, applicable to AI verification. Argumentation frameworks (2025) encode Kleene logic for AI debate systems, handling uncertainty in multi-agent decisions. Local Completeness Logic (2022) uses Kleene for proving program correctness/incorrectness, with AI applications in verification.

#### Gaps and RTKA-U's Contribution
While foundational works like Kleene (1952) and multi-valued logics (Fitting, 1991) establish ternary systems, they lack integrated recursive confidence propagation for decision chains. Recent AI applications (e.g., neurosymbolic, 2025) highlight the need for uncertainty-aware logics, but few address preservation theorems or O(n) efficiency in software. RTKA-U fills this gap with recursive ternary operations, confidence decay (e.g., AND product), and UNKNOWN preservation, validated empirically (e.g., (2/3)^{n-1} probability).

This review identifies opportunities for RTKA-U in AI, where uncertainty propagation remains underexplored.
